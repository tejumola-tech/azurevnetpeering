 üåç Ever wondered how Virtual Networks (VNets) in different Azure regions talk to each other?

That‚Äôs exactly what I explored in my recent project: Azure VNet Peering with Terraform.

üîπ Project Highlights:

Built multiple VNets and subnets across regions.

Configured VNet Peering to enable secure and seamless communication between networks.

Deployed Virtual Machines to validate connectivity across peered VNets.

Automated everything with Terraform, ensuring scalability, repeatability, and consistency.

This hands-on project strengthened my understanding of networking, cloud automation, and IaC best practices in Azure.
